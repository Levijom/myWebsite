		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<img src="profile_pic_1_Compressed.jpg" alt="Picture of me" height="200" align="right">
		<p><h3>Mission Statement:</h3> To gain experience in all things computers, technology, and problem-solving in order to increase compitence in Computer Engineering related fields</p>
		<p><h3>Vision:</h3> To become an industry leader in Computer Engineering either as a team leader or business owner</p>
		<br>
		<p><h3>Who am I?</h3>I study Computer Engineering student at the <a href="https://www.ucf.edu/" target="_blank">Univeristy of Central Florida.</a></p>
		<p>Currently, I am searching for any positions in computers and technology in order to get my technical skills to a top tier level</p>
		<p>In my freetime, I like to mess around with computers and <a href="https://github.com/Levijom">coding</a>, make overly complicated coffee, dabble in the stock market, and learn just about anything that someone is willing to teach me.</p>
		<p>Outside of work and school, I used to play in the band <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCV1hsx8Ip9Q9sOpQaMhMLMg" target="_blank">Stonewash</a> until I left for college in Orlando.</p>
		<br>
		<p><h3>Why do I do what I do?</h3>At my core, I have always had a deep appreciation for  innovation, and always enjoy solving problems</p>
		<p>I would love to have a career where I am solving problems and am keeping up with the cutting edge of new technology</p>
		<p>I know that working in a problem-solving environment would feel more like a hobby than job, and makes me work for so much more than just a paycheck.</p>
		<br>
		<p><h3>How do I hope to accomplish my goals?</h3>I work on many different <a href="Projects.html">projects</a> both in school, and out with groups of people ranging from 2 to 10 people</p>
		<p>Having the mentality of enjoying my engineering coursework, and eventually my job helps me invest not only just time and energy into my education, but also my passion</p>
		<p>My jobs in manual labor, where I was primarially self-manage, Lifeguarding where I took on potentially life-and-death responsibilities, and customer service in restaurant industries give me a well-rounded background of professional experience.</p>
		<br>
