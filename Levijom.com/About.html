		<h1>About Levi</h1>
		<img src="profile_pic_1_Compressed.jpg" alt="Picture of me" height="200" align="right">
		<p>I am a Computer Engineering student at the <a href="https://www.ucf.edu/" target="_blank">Univeristy of Central Florida.</a></p>
		<p>I am currently searching for any positions in computers and technology in order to get my technical skills to a top tier level</p>
		<p>In my freetime, I like to mess around with computers and coding, play music on the drums and guitar, cook new and interesting foods, make overly complicated coffee, and learn just about anything that someone is willing to teach me.</p>
		<p>My old band, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCV1hsx8Ip9Q9sOpQaMhMLMg" target="_blank">Stonewash</a> played for a little while, and released a few songe before I needed to leave for college in Orlando.</p>
		<p>My experience both lifeguarding and bussing tables have given me much experience in fast-paced, and very collaborative working environments, making me a very valuable team player.</p>
		<p>To potential employers; I look forward to getting in touch, please contact me at <a href="mailto:masters.levi@yahoo.com">masters.levi@yahoo.com</a>
		<p>To friends, family, and anyone else who found this site; feel free to leave me feedback on this website.  It would be much appreciated!</p>
