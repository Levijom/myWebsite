			<h3>IT Technician Experience</h3>
			<p>As a student working in the UCF IT office, my roles were dynamic and often involved troubleshooting unusual situations.  Solving problems with faculty and student-facing machines brings many technical challenges, often requiring self-educating on advanced topics on a short notice. In this position I have picked up skills in technological troubleshooting, working in a team, especially with people more technically experienced than I, and various useful bits of technical knowhow as to how computer systems and Enterprise network structures operate. This position really expanded on my ability to work efficiently in a fast-paced and technical environment.</p>
