		<p>The program starts with user input.  It then looks to see if the number the user input it a power of two (2^some number). If it is, that number becomes n.  If it is not, it finds closest power of two below it.  Then the program tests to see if the base (user input) can be divided by n.  When it can, it prints one, when it cannot, it prints a 0.  Each time it tests if b is divisible by n, n gets divided by two, becoming the next lowest power of two.  This test is run until n becomes 1, and our last digit in binary is stated.</p>
