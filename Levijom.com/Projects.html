			<h1>GameFrame: Portable gaming solution</h1>
			<p>The GameFrame is a portable gaming device designed for those who want something more than tapping a screen or keyboard in their gaming experience. It provides a more physical way of interacting with a game, which is something usually restricted to arcades. This device is a stand alone gaming board capable of chess, Connect-4, and Tic-Tac-Toe. It can be played with two players against each other or one player against the AI. The GameFrame is intended to be an enjoyable on the go experience. This machine utilizes an 8x8 grid of buttons that displays the current status of the game and also allows the user to make moves by pressing them. The GameFrame has the versatility for additional games to enhance the user experience. The additional games will only need to be implemented via software configuration.</p>
			<p>My role on this project was the lead programmer on the development team.  I was primarily responsible for the backend application that the GameFrame runs games on. The logic system of the game as well as the AI that played against the user in single player mode. I was largely responsible for testing and partially integrating the engine for usage on the hardware itself.</p>

			<h1>Bestfit Seating</h1>
			<p>This product is for any individual or organization organizing an event who need to seat their guests in a way which helps the event flow more smoothly. The interactive seating chart leads to better organization of your event and less stress during event planning. Unlike many other floor planning programs which allow the user to create a layout of their event and seat their guests, our product offers an automated way of planning a seating chart based on the guest preferences.</p>
			<p>My roles in this project included testing, integration, feature design, and document upkeep. The main function of the project was to learn and implement agile software development and enhanced our abilities to work as a team.</p>
