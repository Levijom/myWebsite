		<p>Using some of the most advanced computing algorithms available today, this page will help make better hiring decisions about potentioal employers</p>
		<p>Though the majority of how it works must be keept secret, we can reveal the basics of how it works;</p>
		<p>In short, the name of a prospective worker is entered in the box, the name is looked up in an advanced database, and if the subject is a viable worker, the verdict is returned as a hit.</p>
		<p>We can say that our machine is, as far as could be told from our testing, 100% accurate!</p>
		<p>Go ahead and try it.  Simply enter the name of an employee below, and a highly accurate hiring decision will be presented</p>
		<p>First Name: <input id="first_name">	Last Name: <input id="last_name">	<button onclick="myFunction()">Submit</button>
		<p id="results"></p>
