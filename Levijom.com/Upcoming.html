		<p>This page is where I will be demonstrating what I am currently learning to do, outside of schoolwork.</p>
		<p>Deep learning:</p>
		<p>Specifically, I am trying to hand code a game of checkers in python using tkinter (suggestions welcome).</p>
		<p>After I develop the checkers game, I would like to set up a neural network to teach it optimal playing strategies.</p>
		<p>Sudoku:</p>
		<p>I am trying to figure out a way to make sudoku in Python.  It would likely be more difficult to figure out the logic of how to make it work, rather than the code it's self.</p>
		<p>Tic-Tac-Toe:</p>
		<p>A simple game of Tic-Tac-Toe against a computer.  I am unsure if i want to have a ridgid set of moves for the computer to make, or incorperate some deep learning</p>
