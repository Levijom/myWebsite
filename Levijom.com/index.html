			<p>Welcome to Levijom.com!  Here, you will find some examples of programs and applications I have coded up in my freetime.  I have compiled as much of it into this site as possible, as to create a one-stop shop for all things related to my experience in computers and IT.  Being a host of projects, this site may be somewhat simple, and lacking in principals of design, however the main goal is to both showcase projects I have built, and to gain some additional experience in interfacing with websites, webhosting, and front-end development.
			<p>On this site, I will be posting projects I am working on under the <a href="Projects.html"/>Projects</a> tab.  I also have an "about me" article in the <a href="About.html"/>About</a> tab.  The <a href="Freelance.html">Qualifications</a> tab is where I have a list of my technical qualifications, experience, and certifications.  There is a page of things I am learning under <a href="Upcoming.html">Upcoming.</a>  Lastly, my contact information and links to my social media, resume, and github are located on <a href="Contact.html">Contact.</a>
