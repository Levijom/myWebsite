		<p>This is an experimental website for Levi Masters which is still very much in the works.</p>
		<p>The goal of this website is to gain experience in all things computers and technology, as well as showcase my tech skills.</p>
		<p>On this site, I will be posting projects I am working on under the <a href="Projects.html"/>Projects</a> tab.</p>
		<p>I also have a small "about me" article in the <a href="About.html"/>About</a> tab.</p>
		<p>The <a href="Freelance.html">Freelance</a> tab is where I host information about possible freelance or odd jobs I am available to do.</p>
		<p>There is a rough page of things I am learning outside of school under <a href="Upcoming.html">Upcoming.</a></p>
		<p>Lastly, my contact information and links to my social media, resume, and github are located on <a href="Contact.html">Contact.</a></p>
